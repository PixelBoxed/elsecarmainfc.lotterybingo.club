Our new {{ site.name }} Lottery Bingo games starts on Saturday, August 8th 2021 and you can join anytime from now up to the time of the Lotto draw on that day.

The joining link can be found at the bottom of this page and you'll be asked to provide a few contact details and your choices of numbers and lines.

We'll register your line(s) into the game and ask you to set up a weekly Standing Order to cover their cost. There's no long term committment here - you can cancel and let us know at anytime if you need to withdraw your numbers for any reason.

We'll begin checking off your numbers from that first Lotto draw. As we do, a new Gamecard menu will appear on this website that you'll be able to use to keep an eye on how your lines are doing.

The money we raise from your lines will be split 50% to the prize fund and 50% to the club with each age group receiving the money that they have raised.

We've had some exciting games in the past and we're looking forward to seeing more of them.

Best of luck!
