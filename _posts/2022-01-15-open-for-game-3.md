Game 2 of our {{ site.name }} Lottery Bingo games was won on Saturday, 15th January 2022. Congratulations to player EMLB008 who scooped £181.50 after only 11 draws.

If you'd like your chance to win, simply [join](https://forms.gle/GEkzAc9o6GSi95vf9) our next game before Saturday, 22nd January 2022. You can enter up to 10 lines of 8 numbers.

The joining link can be found at the top of this page and you'll be asked to provide a few contact details and your choices of numbers and lines. See [how it works](/how-it-works) for more information.

We'll register your line(s) into the game and ask you to set up a weekly Standing Order to cover their cost of £1 per line per week. We'll send you all the details you need for this. There's no long term committment - you can cancel and let us know at anytime if you need to withdraw your numbers for any reason.

We'll begin checking off your numbers from using the National Lottery Lotto draw (using the main 6 balls only). As we do, you can check the Game 3 Gamecard to keep an eye on how your lines are doing.

The money we raise from your lines will be split 50% to the prize fund and 50% to the club.

Our last 2 games have been really exciting and we're looking forward to seeing more of them.

Best of luck!
