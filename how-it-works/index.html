<ol class="list">
    <li class="list-item">You choose 8 different numbers from 1-59 to make up a Lottery Bingo line.</li>
    <li class="list-item">You register your lines with us (up to 15 of them) and we enter them into the next game for you.</li>
    <li class="list-item">You set up a Standing Order to pay Â£1 per line, per week to {{ site.name }}. We'll email you the necessary bank details when you register.</li>
    <li class="list-item">Using the National Lottery Lotto draw on a Saturday Night we'll mark numbers off your line(s). You can monitor them on this website.</li>
    <li class="list-item">A winner or winners will be declared when a line has all 8 numbers marked off and the prize fund will be split between them.</li>
    <li class="list-item">From the money collected 50% goes into the prize fund and 50% goes to {{ site.name }}.</li>
